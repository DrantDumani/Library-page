# Library-page
Library Page app for Odin Project. This project has been developed following the curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). The live page can be found [here](https://drantdumani.github.io/Library-page/). The form uses basic HTML and JS constraint validation.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Known Bugs
- If you try to edit a book, close the form without editing anything, and then try to add a NEW Book normally, no book will be added. Instead, the book you originally tried to edit will be edited instead.
- Validation Error text will sometimes appear after you've already submitted the form. When you re-open it, it will appear to warn users even though they haven't entered any information yet.
